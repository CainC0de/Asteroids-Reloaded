## About
The original and best HTML5 canvas game! :) As featured on Wired: http://www.wired.com/2010/09/play-asteroids-in-html5/
Was originally coded against the very early HTML5 Canvas API for Safari 3 (no, really). But has been enhanced a few times since. The game has been played ~500,000 times on the original website above. Also featured on Chrome Experiments: http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/asteroids-game/

Game uses the Canvas and Audio HTML5 APIs. Graphics are rendered in Lightwave 3D.

See more game and HTML5 canvas/webgl demos on my site: http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev

## Purpose
This project was originally created to learn HTML5 API.

A long term goal of this project is to keep the original Asteroids game alive, while also giving it several quality of life updates to make it a lightweight and fun HTML browser game.
